	<h1>America Universalis Dev Diary 2</h1>
	<h3>By MultiDream</h3>
	<hr>
	<p> Hi Everyone, it's me again. Last week you may have notice there was no dev diary.
		That's because last week, I was working on a program to help build this project
		a little faster, something I call the ConsoleProvinceEditor. </p>

	<p> If you've ever wanted to make major changes to the world map, you may have found that
		Much of the problem in doing that is making many changes over a huge number of files,
		in particular, the province files. With this app, you can change self defined regions
		by writing phrases to them, or deleting phrases from them. It is not ready for
		public use, but you can see the development progress <a href ="https://github.com/MultiDream/ConsoleProvinceEditor">
		on my Github</a></p>

	<p> But anyway, Let's get straight to the progression of the mod:</p>

	<h2>American Tech (0.3.1) Release</h2>
	<p> As of today, Version 0.3, American Tech has been released. </p>
	<p> Across the American World, Feudalism is accepted effectively everywhere,
		excepting in the hordes over the Great Plains. Each nation has had their
		vision expanded to show some level of connection to other groups in the americas.
		Some more bookmarks have been added with just a little hint of things to come
		in further releases :) .</p>
	<h3> The East Coast:</h3>
	<p> On the East Coast, not much has changed, but the American nations are more
		organized than they once more. In the Great Plains, a few nations have yet
		to adopt organized structures of society.

	<h3> California: </h3>
	<p> West of the Rockies, the Californians are relatively isolated from the rest of the
		world. Dangerous tribes control the rockies, and their power is not great enough
		to contest them. This region is empty now, but it is intended to be filled to the brim with
		minor nations by version 0.8 .
	</p>

	<h3> Mexico: </h3>
	<p> Mexico has remained largely unchanged since the previous version. Their vision and tech
		have grown, but the nations there have yet to be revamped properly.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h3> Andea: </h3>
	<p> In the Andean Mountains, the Incan Empire exists as a collection of highly disloyal nobles.
		What could have happened in the past to cause this? Maybe one day we'll find out...
	</p>
	<p>	The Emporer in Cusco holds waning control over nearby nobles and the high priest
		of Ichima, but his control is waning. A Cusco Player may find they may wish to retract even
		further before reuniting the disloyal nobles.
	</p>

	<h3> South America: </h3>
	<p> No major changes have yet come to this region,but here's an image of South
	American Vision at the game's start. </p>

	<hr>
	<p> So what's coming next? Well, version 0.4.0 seeks to make Europe
		a primitive haven. In particular, I'll be making Western into ancient Germanic,
		Eastern into Slavic, and Ottoman into Greek. What does this all actually mean?
		You'll have to wait to see exactly what that could mean in version 0.4.0,
		European Natives!

	<h3>Version History</h3>
	<h3>Sprints/Timeline:</h3>
		<p>
			Note, you'll see I've made changes to the overall timeline.
			As I've worked on this project, I've made changes to what
			each sprint to make them more in line with what I want to
			see happen, and what I think I can accomplish.
		</p>

		<h4 class="complete">Pre-Beta 0.1: American Religions</h4>
		<p>
			This release was completed June 3rd.
			Removes the reformable
			portion of the native faiths. This will
			allow them to accept institutions.
		</p>

		<h4 class="complete">Pre-Beta 0.2: TradeNodes</h4>
		<p>
			This release was completed June 10th.
			Reroutes trade nodes
			to flow ultimately to American nodes.
		</p>

		<h4 class="complete">Pre-Beta 0.3: American Tech</h4>
		<p>
			Reworks american
			technology groups, to make them similar
			to european groups.
		</p>

		<h4 class="workingOn">Pre-Beta 0.4: European Natives</h4>
		<p>
			Reworks European technology groups to make them
			silimar to where American groups were.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.5: Old World</h4>
		<p>
			Drastically reduces the size
			of European nations, lower devlopment significately,
			making it an easy target for annexation. 
			Several Tags will be removed or kept as placeholders
			until their replacement can be arranged.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.6: Institutions</h4>
		<p>
			Change how institutions spawn to decentralize their development,
			and ensure that America has a slight edge in developing them.
			This will also allow different parts of the world to develop 
			institutions somewhat separately.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.7: Ages </h4>
		<p>
			Changes ages and their goals to more closely align with the American
			focus. Nations that gain a special boost will drastically change.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.8: New World</h4>
		<p>
			Drastically increase the amount of development in America.
			Increase the size of many nations, and add several new tags.
		<p>
			This release will constitute the minimal goal for this project.
			At this point, I do not promise any further development,
			but I do plan to maintain the project through each update.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.9: Event Purge</h4>
		<p>
			Remove many of the European based events.
			This may speed the game up, and should fix
			issues from removing a large portion of Europe.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.10: European Religions </h4>
		<p>
			Consolidates Abrahamic religions and lowers their influence drastically.
			Adds new Polystheistic religions to Europe.
			They may have a reform mechanic, I haven't decided.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.11: Governments</h4>
		<p>
			Once Dharma releases, I plan to add unique government reforms
			for the Americas and Europe.
		</p>
		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.12: Events and Lore</h4>
		<p>
			Adds many American Based Events and lore for users to enjoy.
		</p>
		<p>
			From here on, I've not decided a path for this project.
			Most Likely, Ill work on each continent individually,
			and polish the mod until I consider it fully stand alone,
			then make the 1.0 release.
