# America-Universalis

Welcome to the America Universalis Homepage.

##CURRENT VERSION:
Beta 0.5 - Old World

  This version is not considered playable yet.
  If you'd like to use it in your mod, feel free.
  
  In Beta, a game can be played, but it wouldn't be much fun.
  The AI Americans are not strong enough to seriously pose a threat,
  and much of the euro-centric institutions, bonuses and events need
  to be moved into America, and much of the lore is missing.

  If you'd like to play America Universalis,
  I ask that you please wait for the release
  of version 0.8.0 - New World.

##UPCOMING VERSION:
Beta 0.6 - Institutions

	This sprint will focus on moving the euro-centric institutions
	into America, and also make them more broadly spread across the world.
