		<h1>America Universalis Dev Diary 1</h1>
		<h3>By: MultiDream</h3>
		<br>
		<h4>Introduction:</h4>
		<p>Hello fellow EU4 fans! My name is MultiDream, I'm a college undergraduate
			studying Computer Science. Eu4 is one of my favorite games right now,
			and after having gone through an exceptionally difficult Aztec Game,
			I was inspired to create this mod, America Universalis, to tip the balance
			oh so in America's favor. America universalis is my first mod ever published
			to the steam workshop. I'll be working on this mod mostly alone, so while I
			will try to make the most fun product possible, I can't promise preserving
			the game's historical accuracy. I will try to imagine the world as it could
			have been, had america been as advanced as europe and vice versa. While I
			have some basic knowledge of these regions, this is certainly not my expretise.
			I'd also like to note that without play testing, this mod is especially
			prone to bugs. While I appreciate all reports, I simply can't respond to
			everything, so please only refer directly to me if said bug litterally breaks
			the game. With that out of the way, lets move on to goals!</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Goals:</h4>
		<p>
			My hope for this mode is to create a universe in which America is technologically
			Advanced, and Europe is not. Currently, I have no lore for this universe,
			but I am open to suggestions from the community.</p>
		<br>
		<p> 
			This mod will attempt to hold internal historical accuracy. In essence, the
			timeline from start to finish should feel resonable, despite the years prior
			being a bafflinng mystery. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Most importantly, this mod is intended to be fun enough for at least a few campaigns,
			in the changed regions.America should be just as easy, if not easier, to play than in a normal Europe game.
			Vice versa, Europe should be just as difficult as an American Game.
		</p>
		<p>
			I will not that this mod will probably significantly impact events.
			While I'll try to be careful in uprooting events in the base game,
			the volume of that data is so large, I can't make promises. What I can
			promise is new events for America and Europe, to come in a post Beta
			release.
		</p>
		<h4> Release Scheduale</h4>
		<p>
			Unfortunetly for any subscribers, these mods will release pretty unregularly.
			I'll try to make a basic HTML document Dev Diary type thing to give people an
			overview of whats going on, but no promises.
		</p>
		<p>
			Still, I have all the major versions up to the 0.8 beta release planned out,
			as can be seen in developper files, and I'll list the goals for each patch
			upto then.
		</p>

		<h3>Sprints/Timeline:</h3>

		<h4 class="complete">Pre-Beta 0.1: American Religions</h4>
		<p>
			This release was completed June 3rd.
			Removes the reformable
			portion of the native faiths. This will
			allow them to accept institutions.
		</p>

		<h4 class="complete">Pre-Beta 0.2: TradeNodes</h4>
		<p>
			This release was completed June 10th.
			Reroutes trade nodes
			to flow ultimately to American nodes.
		</p>

		<h4 class="workingOn">Pre-Beta 0.3: American Tech</h4>
		<p>
			Reworks american
			technology groups, to make them similar
			to european groups.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.4: European Tech</h4>
		<p>
			Reworks European technology
			groups. Current thought is that it will not
			introduce the primitive modifier, but I have
			yet to make the final decision on that.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.5: Old World</h4>
		<p>
			Drastically reduces the size
			of European nations, lower devlopment significately,
			making it an easy target for annexation. 
			Several Tags will be removed or kept as placeholders
			until their replacement can be arranged.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.6: Institutions</h4>
		<p>
			Moves the Feudal institution out of Europe into
			America, and makes their spawning far less centralized.
			This will allow Asia and America to develop them somewhat separately.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Pre-Beta 0.7: Ages </h4>
		<p>
			Changes ages and their goals to more closely align with the American
			focus. Nations that gain a special boost will be more equally spread
			across the world.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.8: New World</h4>
		<p>
			Drastically increase the amount of development in America.
			Increase the size of many nations, and add several new tags.
		<p>
			This release will constitute the minimal goal for this project.
			At this point, I do not promise any further development,
			but I do plan to maintain the project through each update.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.9: Event Purge</h4>
		<p>
			Remove many of the European based events.
			This may speed the game up, and should fix
			issues from removing a large portion of Europe.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.10: European Religions</h4>
		<p>
			Consolidates Abrahamic religions and lowers their influence drastically.
			Adds new Polystheistic religions to Europe.
			They may have a reform mechanic, I haven't decided.
		</p>

		<h4 class="notReached">Beta 0.11: Events and Lore</h4>
		<p>
			Adds many American Based Events and lore for users to enjoy.
		</p>
		<p>
			From here on, I've not decided a path for this project.
			Most Likely, Ill work on each continent individually,
			and polish the mod until I consider it fully stand alone,
			then make the 1.0 release.
